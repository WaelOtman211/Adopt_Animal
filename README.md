# Adopt_Animal
Adopt Animals is a web application built using React and JavaScript, with a Node.js server.
The application features a catalog of animals, including rabbits, dogs, and horses, each categorized for easy viewing.
The catalog is available for all users to browse, but only registered and logged-in users can adopt an animal.
The app also features a history section where users can view their previously adopted animals. 
Additionally, there is a favorites feature that allows users to mark animals they are interested in.
The application includes a login and signup page for new users.
By clicking on an animal in the catalog, users can see more details about the animal and adopt it if they wish.
